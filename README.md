# Packaged Web Publications

This is the repository of the W3C’s specification on Packaged Web Publications, developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/). 

This work has been superceded by the [Lighweight Packaging Format (LPF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/), released as a W3C Working Group Note.

The original editors’ draft of the Packaged Web Publications specification is [still available](https://w3c.github.io/pwpub/) for the record.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.
