			<p>This specification defines a packaging format for combining the resources of a Web Publication [[?wpub]] into a single
				portable file.</p>
			<p class="note">
				At this point, this is just a skeleton for the specification-to-be. At the moment, the focus of the Working Group is on the Web Publications document.

			<p>
				Due to the lack of practical business cases for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/">Web Publications</a>, and the consequent lack of commitment to implement the technology, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Publishing Working Group</a> has chosen to discontinue the work on Web Publications, archive the work in the form of a Working Group Note, and focus on other areas of interest. As a consequence, the present document has also been <a href='https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#abandon-draft'>discontinued</a> and is being published as a Working Group Note. The public record of the group's discussions is available in group's <a href='https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/Meetings/Minutes/'>archive of meeting minutes</a>. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				The separate <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/'>Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF)</a> Working Group Note fulfills a similar role, albeit with different requirements and goals.

		<section id="introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p class="ednote">The editors request community comments on especially on Sections 2-4 via the groupâ€™s <a href="mailto:public-publ-wg@w3.org">primary mailing list</a>. The <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-publ-wg/">archives</a> are publicly visible, and anyone can post a mail.</p>

			<p class="ednote">A key decision on this specification will be the choice of packaging mechanism (section 5). The working group has decided to evaluate Web Packaging (see the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/master/explainer.md">Web Packaging Format Explainer</a>) and to wait for its maturation before proceeding. This has been a major cause of the publication of this specification as a First Public Working Draft in such skeletal form.</p>

		<section id="conformance">
			
			<section>
				<h2>General Conformance</h2>
				
				<p>A document is a <a>Packaged Web Publication</a> if it:
					
				<ul>
					<li>conforms to [[?wpub]];</li>
					<li>contains all resources that are part of the publication (e.g. reading order and secondary resources);</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Additionally, a document that is a <a>Packaged Web Publication</a> MAY contain:

				<ul>
                                        <li>additional resources that are referenced by the publication (for example a metadata record in a different format);</li>
                                        <li>the request &amp; response HTTP payloads for each resource;</li>
                                </ul>	
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Conformance Classes</h2>
				
				<p>This specification defines two conformance classes: one for <a>Self-Packaged Web Publications</a> and one for
				<a>Standard-Packaged Web Publications</a>.</p>

				<p id="selfpwp-conformance">A document is a <a>Self-Packaged Web Publication</a> if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it conforms to <a href="#descriptiveproperties"></a> but not <a href="#packaging"></a>; that is, it specifies
					its own packaging format.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p id="stdpwp-conformance">A document is a <a>Standard-Packaged Web Publications</a> if it meets the following criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>it conforms to <a href="#descriptiveproperties"></a> and <a href="#packaging"></a>.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Terminology</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt><dfn data-lt="Packaged Web Publications|Packaged Web Publication's">Packaged Web Publication</dfn></dt>
				<dd>

					<p>A <a class="externalDFN" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/#dfn-web-publications">Web Publication</a>&nbsp;[[?wpub]] that has been packaged into a single information resource, enabling it to be transported and stored independent of any specific address or protocol. A Packaged Web Publication does not have to originate on the Web (i.e., have a specific URL that is accessible via HTTP); the only requirement is that it conform to Web Publications. Similarly, it is possible to unpack a Packaged Web Publication to create a Web Publication, but there are practical limitations to doing so (e.g., re-publishing cross-domain resources will require that a client be able to access all domains used).
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><dfn data-lt="Self-Packaged Web Publications|Self-Packaged Web Publication's">Self-Packaged Web Publication</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A <a>Packaged Web Publication</a> [PWPUB] that defines its own package format.
					</p>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><dfn data-lt="Standard-Packaged Web Publications|Standard-Packaged Web Publication's">Standard-Packaged Web Publication</dfn></dt>

		<section id="descriptiveproperties">
			<h2>Descriptive Properties</h2>

			<p class="issue" data-number="10">A Web Publication is anticipated to have some <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/#infoset-meta">Descriptive Properties</a>, or WP-specific metadata. What PWP-specific metadata should a PWP contain, if any?</p>

		</section>

		<section id="packaging">
			<h2>Packaging</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>PWP will require the selection of some sort of packaging format in order to be a
				<strong>Packaged</strong> Web Publication.</p>

				<p>Some options currently under consideration include, but are not limited to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Web Packaging (<a href="https://github.com/WICG/webpackage">WICG Web Packaging Format</a>, <a href="https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/" rel="nofollow">J. Yasskin's drafts</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/master/explainer.md">Web Packaging Format Explainer</a>)</li>
					<li>EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.1 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2017/SUBM-epub-ocf-20170125/" rel="nofollow">W3C Member Submission</a></li>
					<li>Zip/OCF</li>
					<li>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049" rel="nofollow">RFC7049</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>All of these have pros and cons. For example, Web Packaging is not finalized,
				the CBOR specification precludes inclusion of a general compression scheme (although
				one could add one on top of CBOR), and SQLite is not a standard of a recognized body.</p>
			</div>

			<p class="issue" data-number="11">What packaging format or style should a PWP use?</p>

			<h2>Profiles</h2>

			<p class="ednote">The editors realize that the concept of profiles of implementation is probably contentious.
			Much discussion is anticipated before this section is likely to be brought to conclusion.</p>
