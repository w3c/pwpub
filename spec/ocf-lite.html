				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>to exchange in-progress packaged <a>Web Publications</a> between different individuals and/or

					</li>
					<li>
						<p>to provide packaged Web Publications from a publisher or conversion house to the distribution or
							sales channel; and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>to deliver packaged Web Publications to users or <a>User Agents</a>.</p>

				<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section is linked to its definition.</p>

			<h1>Specification</h1>

			<section id="sec-zip">

				<h2>ZIP File Requirements</h2>

				<p>A <dfn data-lt="Lightweight Packaging Format">Web Publication Lightweight Package</dfn> uses the ZIP format as specified in ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015 ([[ZIP]]).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-structure">
		
					<h2>File and Directory Structure</h2>
	
					<p>A Package MUST include at least one of the following files 
						in its <a>Root Directory</a>:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>A file named <code>index.html</code>, which MUST follow the requirements of the 
								<a>Primary Entry Page</a> of the Web Publication.</li>
						<li>A file named <code>manifest.jsonld</code>, 
								which MUST be in the format defined for <a>Web Publication Manifest</a>s.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<p>The contents of both files are specified in [[wpub]]</a>.</p>

					<p>The User Agent MUST obtain the <a>Web Publication Manifest</a> for the publication included in the Package through the following steps:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>If the Package contains an <code>index.html</code> file, 
							the <a>Web Publication Manifest</a> is obtained following the rules 
							described in the relevant section of the Web Publication specification [[wpub]].</li>
						<li>Otherwise, the <code>manifest.jsonld</code> file is used as the <a>Web Publication Manifest</a>.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>If both <code>index.html</code> and <code>manifest.jsonld</code> are present in the Package, then the former SHOULD contain a reference to the latter, following the rules described by the definition of the <a>Primary Entry Page</a>.</p>

					<p>All other files within the Package MAY be in any location descendant from the Root Directory.</p>

					<div class="note">
							<p>Note that the <code>index.html</code> page may contain an embedded manifest, i.e., the <a>Web Publication Manifest</a> may not be explicitly present in the Package.</p>
					</div>

			</section>
		
			<section id="sec-relative-url">

					<h2>Relative URLs for Referencing Other Components</h2>
	
					<p>Files within the Package MUST reference each other via relative URLs, 
						following the rules defined in [[wpub]].</p>
								
					<p>All relative URLs MUST resolve to resources within the Package (i.e. at or
							below the <a>Root Directory</a>).</p>
		
					<div class="note">
							<p>The [[ZIP]] specification has few constraints on the characters allowed for file and directory names. 
								When crafting such names, authors must be careful to use characters which 
								allow a broad interoperability among operating systems and are compatible with relative URLs.</p>
					</div>
	
					<aside class="example">
						<p>In this example, the <a>Web Publication Manifest</a> <code>manifest.jsonld</code> located in the <a>Root Directory</a>  
							 is referenced from the <a>Primary Entry Page</a> via an [[HTML]] <code>link</code> element.</p>
						<pre>
	&lt;link href="manifest.jsonld" rel="publication"/&gt;
						</pre>
					</aside>
				
					<aside class="example">
						<p>In this example, if <code>manifest.jsonld</code> is located in the <a>Root Directory</a>
							and has the following content:</p>
		
						<pre aria-busy="false">
		{
			"resources" : "illustrations/thorium-atom.svg",
			â€¦
		}
						</pre>	
						<p>then the path <code>illustrations/thorium-atom.svg</code> is relative to the <a>Root Directory</a>.</p>

			<h1>The <code>application/lpf+zip</code> Media Type</h1>

			<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/lpf+zip</code> for the Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF).</p>

			<p>A <a>Lightweight Packaging Format</a> (or LPF) file is a container technology based on the
				[[ZIP]] archive format. It is used to encapsulate Web Publications. 
				LPF and its related standards are maintained and defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

							<code>application/zip</code></a> media type.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Security considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>All processors that read LPF files should rigorously check the size and validity of
						data retrieved.</p>
					<p>In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in LPF files
						, <code>application/lpf+zip</code> may describe content that poses security implications
						beyond those noted here. However, only in cases where the processor recognizes and processes the
						additional content, or where further processing of that content is dispatched to other
						processors, would security issues potentially arise. In such cases, matters of security would
						fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
					<p>Security considerations that apply to <code>application/zip</code> also apply to LPF files.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>None.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Published specification:</dt>

					<p>This media type registration is for the Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF), as described by the

								><code>https://github.com/w3c/LPFub/spec/ocf-lite.html</code></a>.</p>

				<dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
